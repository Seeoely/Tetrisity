This is our final project from our graduate level Electronics class. It included a 16 x 16 LED matrix attatched to an Arduino coupled with an IR sensor all on top of a shoe box which held the wiring and remote control. Me and my partner, Jude Huck-Reymond, simulated the retro computer game Tetris using C++ on the arduino; it included the failing condition of a block reaching the top of the grid, a score system from clearning rows, noises for movement, clearing rows, and losing, a TV remote linked with an IR sensor to gather input, animations for starting and losing, block rotation and speed changes, block collision logic, and randomized sequential blocks and colors.
